# Edge IoT

IoT intelligence platform

## Developing

1. Run `docker compose up -d`
2. (maybe not needed) go to `src/edgeiot.client` and `npm install`
3. Open the solution and run the `edgeiot.Server` project. The `edgeiot.client` application should load as well.
4. Use the `mockdevice` tool to test the device-facing APIs
